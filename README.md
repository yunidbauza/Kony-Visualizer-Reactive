# Kony Visualizer Reactive Sample
## Purpose
<p>
The main purpose is showcase how to build a simple Reactive app in Kony Viz 9.x, and to structure our code in a much modern way (ES6) while increasing the rehusable code across different channels. <br />
This sample consists in a single Form with multiple components that refresh seemingly over certain events. It contains a chart, tiles and a segment that react to changes on the data with less that 50 lines of code in the Form Controller.
